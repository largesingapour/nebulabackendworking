### Front-End Not Passing Wallet Context Properly:

If you connect your wallet after initializing the chat/session, or if you don't always include the connected wallet address in messages to Nebula, it may not "see" your wallet at the right moment.
In your sendMessage function, you try to append the wallet address to the user message if present:

if (address) {
  modifiedContent = `${content}\nMy connected wallet address is: ${address}`;
}

- If the `address` variable is undefined (or still loading) at the moment you call `sendMessage`, the modified message won't have your wallet.

2. **Async "Stale" State Issue:**
   - React state updates (like to your `address`) can be one render behind. If your wallet connects just after your chat session is ready, the first call may still miss it.

3. **Nebula Response Cache/Sequence:**
   - If you only send the latest message, not the full context, or the wallet address isn’t included in the latest message, Nebula's backend won’t know what wallet to use.

4. **Wallet Disconnection/Race:**
   - If the wallet was briefly disconnected, or thirdweb's hook returned `undefined` for `address`, Nebula won't have an address, so defaults to showing the warning.

### How to Fix

1. **Always Pass the Latest Wallet Address:**
   - Make sure your logic for building Nebula's message context always has up-to-date wallet info before sending messages expecting a transaction.

2. **Check State Synchronization:**
   - Use React’s up-to-date state (i.e., via `useEffect`, or a full `chatContext` provider) to avoid a stale `address` on first send.
   - Example: disable the chat input until `address` is definitely set, or trigger a re-send quietly after a wallet connects.

3. **Debugging:**
   - Add `console.log({ address, messages, modifiedContent });` just before calling `Nebula.chat`. If `address` is empty, that's your problem.
   - Also check any error feedback from Nebula in its API response.

4. **Reproduce/Confirm:**
   - Try sending a plain message (“what’s my wallet?”) to Nebula, or “prepare a transaction”—see if it detects your wallet now.
   - If the issue only happens on the first message after wallet connect, you have a race condition.

### TL;DR

Your front end warns "issue detecting a connected wallet..." whenever Nebula does not receive a wallet address in message context. To fix:
- Make absolutely sure your messages to Nebula always (and most recently) carry an up-to-date wallet address.
- Check your handling of the `address` variable for "staleness" or lag.
- Consider gating "transaction" features until wallet connect is ready.
